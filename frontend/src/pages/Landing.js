        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="p">
          The SCAN-B cohort includes 3,273 breast cancer (BC) patients, where gene expression profiling by Illumina RNA-sequencing was performed. The aim was to develop mRNA-based classifiers for five key biomarkers: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2, Ki67, and histologic grade (NHG).
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="p">
          These RNA-seqâ€“based classifiers were validated against histopathology and showed similar classification accuracy. Interestingly, discordant classifications (e.g., hormone receptor positive by histology but negative by RNA-seq) were associated with significantly poorer outcomes â€” highlighting the clinical potential of transcriptomic profiling.
